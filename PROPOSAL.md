# Project Proposal

**Project Goal: Piano keyboard**  

I would like to make a piano keyboard that can be played by a computer keyboard.
I want the piano keyboard to have all 88 keys, and since a standard laptop does
not have 88 keys, I will allow the user to octave jump and move across the entire
piano keyboard. In addition, I would like the keys of the keyboard to light up
when played. I have attached a picture down below that gives a good idea on
how the piano keyboard will look.

*Since I still want to create a piano visualizer in the future, extendability will
be heavily emphasized in this project.*

**openFrameworks Usage:**  

I plan on using different 2-D graphics modules and add-ons for the majority of
the project. Additionally, I will use some sound add-ons or modules
