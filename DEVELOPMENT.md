I was originally going to create a Synthesia-like piano program, but due to
a lack of time, I decided to make a full 88-key virtual piano that can
be played with a computer keyboard instead.  

*The Piano Layout:*
I realized that most computer keyboards don't have 88 keys (my mac only has 79).
As a result, I tried to figure out how I could still allow the user to play all
88 keys. I quickly realized that I needed to have an "octave shifting" option.
I eventually decided to allow the user to choose from five different 48-key
layouts on the piano keyboard.  

*The Computer Keyboard Layout:*
After I decided how I would split/set up my piano keyboard, I tried to find the
most optimal set of 48 computer keys for the user to play with. Additionally, I
tried to pick a 48-key layout that works for any computer.  

To choose from the virtual piano's five different 48-key layouts, I will allow
the user to use the left and right arrow keys to shift layouts.  

*Graphics:*
- Each 48-key layout will be outlined with a unique color.
- Every pressed key will light up in accordance to the current layout's outlined color.
